This is front-end part **Chatify** car rental service mini-app. You can find [back-end part here](https://github.com/theodoregold/chatify-backend) and [task description here](https://github.com/theodoregold/chatify-frontend/blob/master/TASK.md).

## Demo

## Note
Project is build using my personal boilerplate and custom components. I acknowledge that using Redux might be an overkill for this project. I also took some creative UI/UX liberties. Most importantly, I didn't redirect the user to the landing page after closed connection. For me, it makes more sense for the user to have access to his conversation.

## Requirements
Your usual suspects
* Node.js (something recent like v8.10)

## Getting started
- `yarn install` or `npm install` for dependencies.
- `yarn start` to start local development and `yarn build` to build.

It should open automatically or type <http://localhost:8080> in your browser.

To change environments you can use `yarn start:dev` or `yarn start:<environment name>` for both `start` and `build`.
